This is a repository for various hobby projects of mine. An interest in math and coding sparked many of these programs
to test my ability and expand my knowledge. I plan to continue to expand many of these projects and create new ones.
This repo includes:
  programs to plot the mandelbrot set
  programs to plot a chaos game sim for a polygon of various side numbers
  a graphing calculator that can graph functions, its derivatives, and antiderivative as well as a tangent line
  a graphing calculator that can plot solution curves to 1st order differential equations
  a graphing calculator that can plot solution curves to 2nd order differential equations
  a program to calculate the first n prime numbers
  and a c++ calculator that has many functions coded from scratch using various techniques, such as
      definite integrals of a funtion
      nth derivatives of a function
      sine, cosine tangent
      arc trig functions
      e^x and ln(x)
      both real branches of the lambert w function
      nth roots of a real number
      factorial
      newtons method with a given value for a function
      complex arithmatic
      complex log
      complex trig
      complex arithmatic like exponentiation, addition, division, multiplication
